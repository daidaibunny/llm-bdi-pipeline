# Research Pipeline Decisions

This document is the maintained pre-paper decision record for the research
pipeline. It records the current architecture, evidence/compiler boundaries,
benchmark scope, certification requirements, supported fragments, and explicit
limitations. It is not the paper narrative and MUST be updated whenever an
implementation change alters a research-facing claim. The normative design for
parametric natural-language LTLf input and temporal evaluation is maintained in
[`input_design.md`](input_design.md).

## Canonical Terminology

**GP2PL** expands to **Generalized Planning to Plan Libraries** and is the
formal name of the complete five-module framework. The Typed Temporal Input
Module, Evidence Module, Validated Policy-Lifting Compiler, Temporal Query
Compiler, and Execution Validation Module retain distinct scopes; GP2PL is not
an alias for any single module. The paper title and prose use GP2PL for the
complete method.

The **Typed Temporal Input Module** maps a controlled natural-language request,
declared typed parameters and constraints, and the public PDDL catalogue to a
fixed eight-key parametric LTLf JSON payload. Its frozen prompt and deterministic
schema, vocabulary, arity, type, parameter, atom-table, and operator checks are
part of the GP2PL contribution. Hidden gold-formula DFA equivalence is used only
to evaluate translation, not as an online acceptance oracle. An input formula
with no `F`, `X`, or `U` is an ordinary achievement query; a formula containing
one of those operators is a temporally extended goal.

**MOOSE evidence** is the readable first-order decision-list output emitted by
`policy --dump-policy`. For example, one evidence rule may associate the
singleton goal `at(package0,location2)` with the fixed primitive sequence
`load-truck; drive-truck; unload-truck` under a regressed state condition. MOOSE
is the current Evidence Module provider; it is not the compiler and does not
generate AgentSpeak(L) query wrappers.

A **macro** is a finite, fixed sequence of primitive PDDL actions in one
evidence rule or action-only plan template. It is not a new PDDL action and is
not a recursive module. For example, `load-truck; drive-truck; unload-truck` is
a macro, whereas `!clear(Y); !on(X,Y)` is a recursive subgoal decomposition.

The **Validated Policy-Lifting Compiler** consumes provider-neutral evidence
and the PDDL action schemas. It canonically lifts provider-local variables,
validates action sequences, generates required
action-schema-derived candidates over the producible target universe, checks binding
and progress conditions, selects a
compact candidate set, and renders the certified atomic module core.
MOOSE and the compiler are upstream and downstream components rather than
alternative planners.

The scientific target is a procedural BDI plan library whose rules have a
trigger, an applicability context, and a body of primitive actions or subsidiary
achievement calls. AgentSpeak(L) is the implemented surface realization of that
target, and Jason is the evaluated interpreter. The paper may therefore claim a
certified BDI plan-library compilation problem, but it must state that execution
has been implemented and evaluated only for the AgentSpeak(L)/Jason realization.
It must not claim portability to another BDI language without a renderer and an
execution study for that language.

The paper denotes the query-independent **certified atomic module core** by
`M_D`. It is the selected set of atomic achievement branches, for example
`+!on(X,Y)` and its closed internal `+!clear(Y)` module. For bound query `q`,
`Q_q` is the query-local plan set containing the top-level goal, DFA dispatch,
and transition-repair plans. For an ordered sequence of appended queries
`q_1, ..., q_k`, the only maintained library is
`L_D^[k] = M_D union (union_{i=1}^k Q_{q_i})`, with `L_D^[0] = M_D`. Appending
a new query `q` gives `L_D^[k+1] = L_D^[k] union Q_q`. `M_D` and `Q_q` are
logical subsets of this one persisted AgentSpeak(L) library, not separate
library files. Code and internal metadata may retain established field names
such as `atomic_library`, but the manuscript uses this notation to separate
mathematical roles from storage layout.

**Clingo** is the Answer Set Programming solver used for constrained branch
selection. It does not plan in a PDDL state space and does not execute actions.
The compiler presents candidate branches, evidence-coverage obligations,
internal-call closure requirements, incompatibility constraints, and a
lexicographic cost objective; Clingo returns an optimal selected subset within
the generated certified candidate set.

An **obligation** is a condition the compiler must establish. A **witness** is
finite evidence for one obligation, such as a symbolic derivation, ranking, or
resource-mode path. A **certificate** is the finite, machine-recheckable record
linking a candidate branch, selected atomic core, serialization, or controller
to its applicable obligations and witnesses; a prose metadata label is not a
certificate. **Certification** checks that record, and **certified** describes
one of those compiler outputs only after all required checks pass.
`Cert_D(b)` is the branch-certification predicate, not a certificate object.
Branch-local witnesses cover binding, symbolic execution, achievement,
completion effects, recursive progress, and resource discharge; coverage,
internal-call closure, and compatible dependency ranks are set-level checks. A
transition certificate records its selected portfolios, effect-summary
completeness, induced threats, and safe serialization. Optimality is claimed
only within the resulting certified candidate set.

The term **producible target universe** has one exact meaning. If
`goalPred(E)` is the set of predicates targeted by positive evidence and
`prod(D)` is the set of predicate symbols occurring in positive PDDL add
effects, then `T_D(E) = goalPred(E) union prod(D)`. Candidate modules are
generated for these Boolean targets. Static predicates remain context-only;
delete-only dynamic predicates are not invented as positive targets. Numeric
equalities use their own target set and do not suppress `prod(D)`.

The term **internal-call closure** is a different, set-level selection property.
For any BDI plan set `R`, `Closed_D(R)` means that every internal achievement
call `!g(...)` occurring in a selected body has a type-compatible `+!g(...)`
plan in the same set. Applying the condition to every plan also closes
transitive calls. Primitive PDDL actions are not internal achievement calls.
Do not use the unqualified phrase `schema closure` for both target expansion and
this selection obligation.

## Canonical Formal Notation

The manuscript, supplement, figures, and paper-facing reports use one symbol
for each semantic object:

- `D=<P,F,A,T>` is the typed planning domain; a problem instance is
  `I=<D,O_I,s_I^0,G_I>`, where `O_I` is its finite typed object set;
  `I_train` is the finite training instance set. It may be curated or produced
  before evidence extraction by a pinned parameterized PDDL problem generator.
  Generator revision, digest, parameters, seeds, output manifest, and a
  content-disjoint sealed test split are then part of provenance. This scales
  evidence acquisition and domain onboarding, not the compiler's supported
  fragment or certification criteria. `E_raw` is one provider-native
  singleton-goal policy representation;
  `E_0` is the provider-normalized evidence program; and
  `E = CanonicalLift_D(E_0)` is its typed, alpha-normalized singleton-goal
  evidence program. Canonical lifting preserves repeated-variable sharing and
  PDDL domain constants; it does not relearn a first-order policy from ground
  plans. `e` is one canonically lifted evidence rule.
- `T_D(E)=goalPred(E) union prod(D)` is the Boolean producible target universe,
  and `T_D^Z(E)` is the admitted singleton bounded-integer equality target set.
- `G` is the domain-independent candidate-construction grammar. The finite
  action-schema-derived branch set is
  `C_D(E)=Inst_D(G,T_D(E),T_D^Z(E))`; `C_E` is the validated evidence-branch
  set; and `C_{D,E}=C_E union C_D(E)` is the generated candidate set.
- `G_D^prod(T)` is the producer--precondition dependency graph reachable from
  target set `T`; schema regression is admitted only when this graph is acyclic.
- `b=<g_b,C_b,beta_b,Sigma_b,pi_b>` is one candidate branch. `Sigma_b` is its
  conditional module-completion summary and `Cert_D(b)` its
  branch-certification predicate.
- `rho_b` is a same-predicate recursive ranking, `kappa_M` a cross-module
  dependency ranking, and `G_b^res=(V_b^res,E_b^res)` the finite keyed
  resource-mode graph used by a target-preserving resource-discharge
  certificate. Its labelled edges are target-preserving symbolic action-schema
  transitions between alpha-normalized occupancy modes.
- `C_D^nr(E)` is the nonrecursive action-schema-derived obligation set and
  `realizes_D(b,c)` its schema-achievement relation.
  `C^check_{D,E}` is the certified candidate set. `Omega_{D,E}` contains
  evidence coverage, nonrecursive schema-achievement coverage, preparation
  acyclicity, and recursive-ranking compatibility;
  per-branch resource discharge belongs to `Cert_D(b)`. `F_{D,E}` is the
  family of candidate cores that also satisfy `Closed_D`. `M_D` is the
  lexicographic optimum in that family and is the certified atomic module core.
- `tau_q=<iota_q,varphi_q,mu_q,Theta_q,Gamma_q>` is an unbound query
  specification. `Theta_q:Xbar_q->T` is its parameter type signature,
  `theta_q:Xbar_q->O_I` is an external type-consistent binding into the invoked
  problem instance's finite typed object set `O_I`, and
  `hat(tau)_q=(tau_q,theta_q)` is the validated bound query.
- `D_q=<Q_q^dfa,2^AP_q,delta_q,q_q^0,F_q>` is the deterministic finite
  automaton, `val_q` maps PDDL states to valuations over `AP_q`, and `d_q(z)` is
  shortest directed distance to acceptance. Guard `chi`
  induces signed obligation `O_chi`; `Pi_{chi,i}` is an
  occurrence-specific preservation portfolio; `prec_chi` is the
  threat-induced precedence relation; `ell_chi` its certified serialization;
  and `R_{q_s,chi}` the plan set for that source-state transition obligation.
- `W_{q_s}` is the non-progress self-loop guard set and `I_{q_s}` its signed
  intersection invariant; `rho_num` is the lexicographic
  numeric-progress ranking, and `b_chi^joint` a complete joint
  guard-establishment branch. `R_chi[i,j]` is one transition-repair subtree,
  `c_{q_s,chi}` its source-state completion test, and `Pass_{q_s,chi}` one
  complete transition-repair pass.
- `Q_q` is the complete query-local controller plan set and `L_D^[k]` the sole
  maintained domain library. DFA states `Q_q^dfa` and query plans `Q_q` remain
  typographically distinct.

Use the academic terms `action-schema candidate generation`, `candidate
certification`, `conditional module-completion summary`,
`target-preserving resource discharge`, `ranked cross-module precondition
repair`, `preservation portfolio`, `joint guard-establishment certificate`, and
`balanced binary transition-repair tree`. Do not use `schema closure`, bare
`candidate space`, `existential preparation projection`, `whole-guard helper`,
or bare `repair tree` in research-facing prose.

The **Temporal Query Compiler** is the third production component. It consumes
a validated lifted LTLf query specification and derives `Q_q`, whose plans call modules
in `M_D` and update `L_D^[k]` to `L_D^[k+1]`. The concrete AgentSpeak
realization uses query-local `trans` goals. For an atemporal achievement formula
`psi`, compilation first applies the canonical completion embedding `F(psi)`;
TEG formulae are unchanged. Both then use the same real LTLf2DFA/MONA and
controller path. The **Temporal Goal Validation
Module** is a separate evaluation component. It validates a predicted lifted
LTLf against the sealed gold temporal semantics, replays hidden source
witnesses, and checks generated execution traces with both PDDL action
semantics and DFA acceptance.

## Reproducibility and Public Code-and-Data Contract

The manuscript presents GP2PL as a theoretical representation-compilation
framework. Its primary scientific objects are the normalized singleton-goal
evidence relation, the finite candidate-construction grammar and generated
certified set, the feasible-library selection problem, conditional
module-completion summaries, and preservation-safe DFA
guard composition. MOOSE, Clingo, AgentSpeak(L), and Jason are the evaluated
provider, optimizer, rendering language, and interpreter. Paths, worker
scheduling, hashes, and command-line details belong in reproducibility material,
not in the statement of the method.

The canonical technical supplement is
`latex_code/aamas_method_paper/technical_appendix.tex`. It contains the formal
definitions, assumptions, complete proofs, theory-to-code map, data appendix,
source provenance, experimental parameters, hardware/software environment,
distributional statistics, and claim-to-test map. The versioned public evidence
is maintained under:

```text
paper_artifacts/temporal_goal_benchmark/v1
paper_artifacts/temporal_semantic_conformance/v1
paper_artifacts/gp2pl_evaluation/v1
```

The temporal-goal dataset is independently citable through its own README,
CC BY 4.0 notice, and `CITATION.cff`. Its 475 translation inputs and 1,228 bound
query cases report exact automaton-language equivalence and sealed-witness
acceptance. Runtime controller results remain a separate evaluation record.
Publication metadata and source archives must pass the portable-path and hash
checks in `scripts/verify_public_teg_dataset.py`.

GP2PL source code is released under Apache-2.0, and original GP2PL temporal
annotations, specifications, generated libraries, and result records are
released under CC BY 4.0. Third-party PDDL and MOOSE materials retain upstream
terms and are reconstructed from pinned sources. They must not be represented
as GP2PL-licensed data. The reproducibility checklist scopes source-code
availability to every GP2PL-authored implementation, preprocessing, execution,
and analysis file, all of which is included and Apache-2.0 licensed. Public
third-party dependencies are cited and fetched at pinned revisions under their
own terms; they are not omissions from the authored code appendix. All novel
GP2PL data, including the sealed construction audit withheld from the translation
model during inference, is included in the public CC BY 4.0 release. Therefore
no experimental dataset remains non-public.

The camera-ready public repository is
`https://github.com/daidaibunny/gp2pl`. The anonymous submission and technical
supplement must not expose this identifying URL. The main LaTeX source therefore
keeps the repository paragraph behind a camera-ready-only conditional. Review
material uses an anonymized code-and-data archive. Checklist answers are changed
to `yes` only when the paper, technical supplement, or submitted archive contains
the corresponding evidence. The statistical-significance answer is `yes` only
in the precise sense that the manuscript makes no untested inferential claim:
fixed-release differences remain descriptive, and any future improvement claim
is gated on the registered paired five-seed analysis.

This repository no longer builds a universal generalized planner and no longer
routes domains by prior-paper taxonomy labels. The Typed Temporal Input Module
produces validated parametric LTLf; the Evidence Module imports provider-native
singleton-goal policy representations and normalizes them into provider-neutral
singleton-goal evidence. The compiler constructs `M_D` from accepted evidence;
later queries contribute `Q_q` to the same maintained `L_D^[k]`. MOOSE is the
current Evidence Module provider for positive singleton PDDL predicate goals;
it is not the name of the framework module.

## Compiler Contract

The architecture separates five modules.

1. The Typed Temporal Input Module maps a controlled-language request, typed
   parameters and constraints, and the public PDDL catalogue to validated
   parametric LTLf JSON under the fixed prompt and payload contract. It does not
   ground parameters, select objects, or choose actions.
2. The Evidence Module imports provider-native policy representations and emits a
   `PolicyEvidenceProgram`. A `PolicyEvidenceProgram` is the common evidence
   intermediate representation: it records a provider name, a source file,
   and singleton-goal policy rules. For example, the MOOSE adapter parses a
   `policy --dump-policy` first-order decision-list rule whose singleton goal is
   `at(package0, location2)` and whose macro sequence loads a package, flies it,
   unloads it, drives it by truck, and unloads it at the destination.
3. The Validated Policy-Lifting Compiler consumes the evidence program plus the
   PDDL domain schema. A PDDL domain schema is the action-schema file, for
   example a `drive-truck` action with typed parameters, preconditions, add
   effects, and delete effects. The compiler checks that evidence actions replay
   through those schemas, lifts object names to variables, generates candidates
   for the producible target universe, enforces internal-call closure, selects a
   compact branch set, and renders
   the certified atomic module core `M_D`, including plans such as
   `+!at(X,Y)`.
4. The Temporal Query Compiler consumes validated lifted LTLf/DFA query
   specifications, constructs the query-local plan set `Q_q`, and appends it to the
   maintained library, updating `L_D^[k]` to `L_D^[k+1]`.
5. The Execution Validation Module evaluates translation with gold/predicted DFA
   language equivalence and the hidden source witness, then consumes the
   committed trace produced by the separate Jason runtime. It validates that
   trace independently with PDDL replay, VAL, and gold-DFA acceptance. Gold
   equivalence is an experimental oracle, not an online input check.

## Experimental Comparison Contract

The framework is not evaluated as though it were one more per-instance PDDL
planner. MOOSE is one instantiated Evidence Module provider; the proposed
components are the Typed Temporal Input Module, Validated Policy-Lifting
Compiler, and Temporal Query Compiler. Baselines and ablations therefore match
one module boundary at a time.

### Primary Atomic Comparison

All atomic variants consume the same serialized `PolicyEvidenceProgram`, PDDL
domain, train/test split, and evidence hash.

| Method | Native behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Evidence Only | Validate each evidence macro by symbolic PDDL execution and render the surviving lifted macro plans. Do not expand over the producible target universe, add internal subgoal modules, or optimize branches. |
| Direct Producers | Add every certified action-only PDDL producer candidate for the producible target universe. |
| Maximum Feasible | Generate the full certified candidate set and use Clingo to retain a maximum-cardinality jointly feasible program under the same internal-call, ranking, and resource constraints as the full method. This is not an unchecked union of individually certified branches. |
| Full GP2PL | Minimize branch, context, and body cost over the same generated certified set and hard certification constraints used by Maximum Feasible. |

Evidence Only is deliberately a strong baseline rather than an unchecked text translator.
It preserves all provider macros that meet the same schema validation used by
the full method. Maximum Feasible versus Full GP2PL changes only the
optimization objective, so differences in output size and Jason matching cost
can be attributed to compact selection. The machine-readable variant values are
`validated_evidence_adapter`, `action_only_closure`,
`maximal_certified_program`, and `full`; manuscript tables use the short names
above. These four cumulative variants are the complete registered atomic
baseline and ablation matrix. Individual progress, resource, and preparation
checks are not registered switches: disabling a required check while retaining
the branch would be unsound, while removing one constructor family changes
the feasible closure problem rather than isolating a single downstream choice.
Those mechanisms are instead exercised by the fail-closed challenge
matrix and reported through structured rejection diagnostics.

### Primary Temporal Comparison

All temporal variants consume the same atomic-library hash, validated lifted
LTLf JSON, binding, real MONA-derived DFA, and Jason PDDL environment.

| Method | Native behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Unprotected Serialization | Use the real DFA and primitive-step monitor, but serialize each transition guard in a deterministic canonical order without completion-effect threat ordering or occurrence-specific preservation portfolios. |
| Module-Return Monitor | Retain completion-effect certification and the balanced controller, but check the DFA only after an invoked atomic achievement module finishes all primitive actions and returns control to the query controller. Omit primitive-prefix source-invariant filtering because intermediate primitive states are outside this ablation's observation semantics. |
| Certified Balanced | Use complete effect summaries, threat-safe order, per-occurrence preservation portfolios, balanced repair, and primitive-step monitoring. |

All three reported temporal variants run the same complete 1,228-case benchmark.
The causal interpretation of Module-Return Monitor versus Certified Balanced
focuses on cases with intermediate-state obligations, where their observation
boundaries can change acceptance; the remaining paired cases still contribute
coverage, size, and runtime measurements.

Unprotected Serialization and Module-Return Monitor are evaluation modes, never
production fallbacks. The historical
sequence-only PDDL-goal wrapper may be retained only as a weak evaluation
reference in isolated runs; production temporal append always follows the
real DFA transition path. The three rows above are the reported
temporal baseline and ablation matrix. Signed-negative and bounded-numeric cases
remain in the full benchmark and are reported by support and failure status;
there is no separate unimplemented capability-switch row.

### External References and Fairness

Raw MOOSE execution distinguishes evidence quality from compiler and
AgentSpeak execution. LAMA for classical instances, ENHSP MRP+HJ for numeric
instances, FOND4LTLf plus LAMA for temporal product compilation, and TIDE plus
LAMA for automaton-trace decomposition are external task-level references.
Their outputs and cost structures differ from a reusable
AgentSpeak library, so they are reported separately from compiler and controller
ablations. Plan4Past supplies the experimental design precedent of fixing the
downstream planner while comparing temporal compilations; its pure-past input is
not treated as directly interchangeable with our future LTLf input without a
separately proved language-equivalent translation.

The MOOSE achievement reference is partitioned by provenance before scoring.
For the twelve domains in the original MOOSE benchmark, the external table uses
the five-model mean coverage reported in Table 4 of arXiv `2511.11095v1`: 360.0
of 360 numeric cases and 719.6 of 720 classical cases, including 89.6 of 90 for
Logistics. These values are labelled `Reported`; they are not presented as a
local reproduction, and their runtime and memory are not compared with local
measurements. For the four GP2PL-added domains (`blocksworld-clear`,
`blocksworld-on`, `blocksworld-tower`, and `depots`), Raw MOOSE is executed
locally for seeds 0--4 and labelled `Measured`. The scopes are disjoint and
fixed independently of their outcomes: no domain is switched between published
and local values after inspection. A completed local full-seed run may be kept
as a reproduction diagnostic, but it is not an input to the headline external
reference row.

The native achievement reference runner is
`scripts/run_external_planning_references.py`. Raw MOOSE executes the exact
learned model; LAMA is invoked as `search lama-first` from the official MOOSE
container image; ENHSP uses the pinned `sat-hmrphj` configuration. Every nonempty
achievement plan must pass VAL against the original PDDL goal. The native direct
temporal runner is `scripts/run_direct_temporal_reference.py`. Its
`fond4ltlf_lama` mode grounds only the declared invocation binding, invokes
official FOND4LTLf v0.0.4, solves the compiled deterministic instance with the
same LAMA backend, and removes only the compiler's `trans-*` DFA-update actions.
Its `tide_lama` mode renders the persisted validated LTLf query and binding as a
temporal PDDL goal, then invokes official TIDE with feedback, trace heuristic,
prefix caching, and Fast Downward `lama-first`. Before invocation, a bijective
category-scoped alpha-renaming removes ambiguity between TIDE's underscore AP
separator and PDDL symbols, while a dependency-preserving rewrite declares
parent types before their children. Temporal operators are recognized from
their syntax-tree positions and arities, so a domain predicate such as
`next/2` is alpha-renamed without rewriting the LTLf `next` operator. Projected
actions are decoded to the original PDDL vocabulary before replay and
validation. TIDE front-end contract errors are infrastructure failures, not
planning failures. TIDE's `next` node is the upstream pddlboat strong-next
operator `X[!]`, and `until` is strong `U`; the adapter preserves the declared
formula semantics. The gold formula is never
supplied to TIDE search; it remains an independent validation oracle. Both modes
submit only original PDDL actions to replay, neutral-goal VAL, gold-DFA
acceptance, and predicted-DFA acceptance. Neither consumes an atomic ASL library.

FOND4LTLf v0.0.4 is an explicit partial reference: it rejects numeric PDDL and
numeric atoms, and its underscore atom encoding is accepted only when predicate
and object identifiers are unambiguous. A semantics-preserving requirements
normalization maps declarations such as `:negative-preconditions` to `:adl` for
the tool parser and removes an unused `:action-costs` declaration when the domain
contains no functions or numeric effects, without changing action formulas.
Unsupported inputs are counted
as outside tool applicability, not planner failures. FOND4LTLf compilation and
LAMA search share one 1,800-second, 8-GiB per-query budget. TIDE receives the
same total budget and a 60-second limit for each generated Fast Downward
subproblem. Its adapter accepts deterministic predicate PDDL in the declared
LTLf fragment and rejects resource-numeric PDDL and numeric atoms rather than
approximating them. The setup contract in
`scripts/setup_external_planning_references.sh` pins ENHSP revision
`537bed55a60d9456975c56afbadd50fc8acb1dc9`, FOND4LTLf revision
`011d9d9a5bfd6406d2c358faf8f63167f6c839bb`, TIDE revision
`9bdd247752817352714eac115ea6b78d90f26c09` and its recursive submodules, VAL revision
`3c7a1f330bdab0ba28a4762bb45c3f06c27fb6d4`, its Python dependencies, and
MONA 1.4-18; `--check` verifies functional Java and MONA runtimes plus all
pinned sources, archive digests, and the revision-labelled official TIDE
`linux/amd64` image without modifying them. The exact
MOOSE-hosted LAMA image is extracted once into a hash-checked Apptainer sandbox.
The sandbox avoids per-process loop-device allocation, and every Raw MOOSE or
LAMA case mounts a private `/work/out` directory. FOND4LTLf keeps the pinned
`ltlf2dfa` 1.0.2 implementation but redirects its fixed `automa.mona` scratch
path into a per-case directory. These two isolation boundaries remove the prior
host-wide runtime locks while retaining the pinned planners. The registered
remote LAMA/MRP+HJ and direct FOND4LTLf reference matrices use 20 case workers;
the complete TIDE matrix uses 12, and the paired compiler and local Raw MOOSE
extension matrices retain six.
Runs with more than one MOOSE-backed worker fail before scheduling if the
hash-checked sandbox is absent. `--resume` reuses scientific planner outcomes
but retries infrastructure failures.

An infrastructure repair may replace only the exact case set labelled as
infrastructure failures in a complete registered summary. The primary remote
matrix retains 20 workers, while the repair run uses one worker so it does not
compete with another experiment. The merge rejects missing or extra retry
cases, changed semantic inputs, tool-version or resource-limit drift, and any
remaining infrastructure failure. The experiment owner confirms that the local
and remote machines have equivalent configurations and comparable resource
availability, and queue waiting is excluded from measured case runtime;
therefore repaired case runtimes remain eligible for PAR-2. Generated Python
entry points and MONA launchers may contain machine-local installation paths;
those paths and their byte identities are not public result fields.
Planner failures, timeouts, unsupported inputs, compiler failures, and
validation failures are never selected for repair.

Five fixed MOOSE seeds are run independently with one internal MOOSE worker for
the GP2PL-added-domain extension. Evidence is never unioned and a best seed is
never selected. Every paired compiler comparison uses the same seeded evidence
assignment and held-out identifiers for all variants. Every paired temporal
comparison uses the same declared atomic core, query binding, DFA, and case set.
Report
each locally measured extension seed, mean and sample standard deviation,
paired coverage differences, PAR-2 for timeouts, and plan length only on jointly
solved instances. Keep
evidence synthesis, domain compilation, query append, execution, and validation
times separate. The registered MOOSE Table 4 coverage is the sole published
value copied into a result table; its source, five-seed aggregation, benchmark
scope, and absence of comparable local timing are explicit.

The rejection suite is part of the evaluation rather than an implementation
unit test only. It covers unbound variables, incomplete internal-call closure,
non-decreasing recursion, incomplete target-preserving resource discharge,
cyclic or incomplete completion threats,
forbidden negative-guard `MayAdd`, and numeric overshoot. Metamorphic tests apply
predicate/action/object renaming, compatible parameter permutation, and
irrelevant-fluent injection. These are the empirical checks behind the
domain-independent and fail-closed claims.

The native paired harness is `scripts/run_paired_compiler_experiments.py`.
It can generate five isolated MOOSE evidence batches or consume explicit
`SEED=BATCH_ID` assignments, then invokes the production full-test and temporal
benchmark runners once per registered method. Atomic pairing requires the same
seeded evidence assignment and held-out case set for every method at a given
seed and domain. Temporal pairing requires the same benchmark cases, atomic
core, query bindings, and guarded DFA structure for every method. For the
registered `--stage all` release, all temporal variants consume the declared
seed-0 Full GP2PL libraries. Public records expose complete paired outcomes and
protocol fields, not source revisions or byte fingerprints. Internal transient
fingerprints may still protect resume operations from mixing inputs, but they
are not scientific results or publication eligibility criteria.
Maximum trigger fan-out is measured only over transition-repair controller
plans: flat repair siblings, or balanced entry, range, leaf, done, and replay
plans. Query-local preserving-branch and support-helper portfolios remain part
of controller size but are excluded from this structural tree metric.
An evidence failure blocks its dependent runs, and an incomplete pairing is
persisted as an infrastructure failure in `paired_results.json`; it is not
silently dropped or interpreted as method failure.

For every paired seed/domain group, producible-predicate coverage uses one
PDDL-derived denominator: all predicate symbols in positive action effects, as
reported by Full GP2PL's schema analysis. Each method is scored from the
module triggers it actually emits. A reduced baseline cannot turn missing
closure metadata into a vacuous `0/0`; a missing common denominator is an
infrastructure failure.

The main manuscript reports paired endpoint results through generated tables,
not a multi-panel empirical figure. This is appropriate because the benchmark
domains are heterogeneous and the core claims concern exact valid-case counts,
library structure, and effects of certification checks rather than one shared
continuous difficulty axis. `scripts/generate_aaai_figures.py` may still regenerate the
former three-panel view from the complete frozen
`paired_ablation_results.json` as a supplementary diagnostic plot. Dirty
revisions, incomplete seed/domain/variant matrices, unpaired hashes, or protocol
mismatches produce a diagnostic instead of a PNG. The manuscript label for
`validated_evidence_adapter` remains `Evidence Only`.

The main visual program separates abstraction from instantiation. Figure 1
states the representation bridge. Figure 2 exposes both compiler-stage flows.
Its temporal half embeds a compact MONA DFA for one bound Blocks World query,
the certificates for one singleton and one conjunctive progress guard, their
query-local repair controllers, and the shared dispatcher. This concrete chain
prevents the DFA-guided compiler from being represented only by unexplained
process boxes. Figure 3 separately shows execution of the selected
variable-level atomic core on an unseen Blocks stack and is placed after
feasible-core optimization. Main-paper results use exact generated
tables; per-profile, per-domain, per-seed, runtime, and diagnostic views belong
in the Technical Supplement. The main paper reports the identical 740
added-domain seed--case comparison with Raw MOOSE and the 492 Boolean temporal
queries accepted by the direct FOND4LTLf adapter; unsupported inputs remain
separate. The complete scope-separated MOOSE, LAMA, MRP+HJ, FOND4LTLf, and
TIDE matrix remains in the Technical Supplement as per-domain
`valid/supported` cells. A dash denotes only an entirely unsupported domain;
supported failures remain in the denominator. This avoids a cross-scope
ranking in the main paper. TIDE admits all 868 Boolean
queries and validates 675; its 360 numeric inputs remain explicitly
unsupported.

Machine-readable result files retain stable identifiers such as
`validated_evidence_adapter` and `certified_balanced`. Manuscript tables and
terminal summaries use short method names and short column phrases, for example
`Evidence Only`, `Full GP2PL`, `Valid Traces`, and `Time (s)`. Numeric
labels such as `C0`, `T1`, or compressed slash-only headings are not used as
paper table headers.

The completed Raw MOOSE extension matrix is frozen by
`scripts/freeze_raw_moose_extension_results.py` into
`paper_artifacts/gp2pl_evaluation/v1/raw_moose_extension_five_seed_summary.json`.
The freeze applies the predeclared four-domain case contract to each source
summary, so the earlier seed-0 1,228-case superset contributes only its same 148
extension cases. The five selected counts are 26, 23, 23, 25, and 20 valid
plans; the portable release retains all 740 case outcomes and the declared
protocol but removes commands, run bookkeeping, and machine-local paths. The main-paper MOOSE table
is emitted in the same deterministic freeze transaction and checked in beside
the registered arXiv-v1 Table-4 reference; the frozen JSON is the sole local
numeric record thereafter. The admissibility gates are the complete case set,
declared tool and resource protocol, completion status, and VAL result. Timing
is excluded.

The final comparison release is generated by
`scripts/generate_aaai_comparison_tables.py`. It requires the complete paired
compiler result, the checked
`paper_artifacts/gp2pl_evaluation/v1/moose_published_reference.json`, five
separately assigned four-domain Raw MOOSE extension summaries, one native
LAMA/MRP+HJ summary, one FOND4LTLf plus LAMA summary, and one clean challenge
matrix, while the external-reference freeze additionally requires one complete
TIDE plus LAMA summary. It rejects missing seeds or variants, mismatched case sets, incomplete
pairing, and infrastructure failures. The published-reference record fixes
the arXiv version, table number, per-domain means, and three immutable scope
contracts: 1,080 original MOOSE cases, 148 locally measured extension cases,
and their 1,228-case union. The paired manifest
derives immutable case-set contracts from the selected repository inputs: 1,228
achievement cases, 1,228 temporal cases, 868 classical LAMA cases, and 360
numeric MRP+HJ cases. The generator checks every complete identifier set and
rejects omissions, duplicates, or substitutions even if every compared method
made the same mistake. It binds each local Raw MOOSE extension run to its
declared seed and evidence assignment,
checks six workers for the paired compiler and Raw MOOSE extension matrices, 20 workers
for the remote LAMA/MRP+HJ and direct FOND4LTLf matrices, 12 for TIDE, the common
1,800-second and 8-GiB external-planner limits, and the paired compiler's
64-MiB Java stack. When an external matrix contains an infrastructure repair,
it additionally requires an exact one-worker retry set, unchanged inputs,
tool versions, and resource limits plus explicit hardware-equivalence and
runtime-comparability attestations.
The challenge input must contain exactly the 13 unique registered nodes with 13
successes. LaTeX cells and the compact release JSON are generated from those
checked result files; aggregate values are never typed into the manuscript by hand.
The independently generated external-reference release is
`paper_artifacts/gp2pl_evaluation/v1/external_reference_results.json`. It
contains 3,684 portable case records: the complete 1,228-case achievement
matrix and separate complete 1,228-case FOND4LTLf and TIDE temporal matrices. It can be frozen before
the paired compiler matrix completes, but the final combined comparison
generator must reproduce its external rows exactly.
The paired compiler release is
`paper_artifacts/gp2pl_evaluation/v1/paired_ablation_results.json`. It contains
all 24,560 portable atomic outcomes and 4,912 portable temporal outcomes,
adjacent-method exact paired contrasts, corrected transition-repair fan-out,
and paired protocol contracts. The generated atomic and
temporal tables and macros are the only manuscript insertion path for these
values. The optional diagnostic plot is regenerated from the same release and
is never reconstructed from LaTeX cells or used as a main-paper result figure.

The same paired release contains an integrated cross-seed temporal extension.
It applies only the selected Certified Balanced temporal compiler to the same
1,228 bound queries over each of the five independently seeded Full GP2PL
atomic-library sets, for 6,140 additional case outcomes. This extension tests
whether the final temporal method is robust to evidence-seed variation; it does
not recast the four seed-0 temporal ablation variants as a five-seed ablation.
Seed-specific evidence is neither pooled nor selected by best outcome. The
seed-0 record includes only the already registered, fully validated targeted
correction for `logistics_p0_24`. Certified Balanced validates all 6,140
executions; all 1,228 queries succeed under every seed, no case is
seed-sensitive, and primitive-action counts are invariant across seeds. Mean
per-seed PAR-2 is 5.36 seconds with a 0.27-second sample standard deviation.

The generated paired-ablation tables use bold for tied best results and blue
bold for the selected configuration or its structurally distinguishing metric.
Captions state this convention, so color is redundant. External-reference rows
with disjoint case sets are not visually ranked or colored.

The companion `scripts/run_certificate_challenge_matrix.py` executes the
registered rejection and symbol-invariance cases against production compiler
entry points through exact test nodes. The public challenge record retains each
case identity and outcome; local commands and source bookkeeping remain
transient. A failed challenge is an
infrastructure/claim failure for the paired experiment run, whereas an ordinary
held-out planning failure remains a measured method outcome.

## Temporal Goal Validation Contract

One benchmark record is
`B_i = <D, P_i, q_i, T_i, theta_i, pi_i>`. Here `D` is the PDDL domain,
`P_i` supplies the initial state and objects, `q_i` is the public controlled
natural-language query, `T_i` is the sealed gold lifted LTLf, `theta_i` is the
hidden variable-to-object assignment, and `pi_i` is a short legal witness
trace. The original achievement goal in `P_i` is provenance only and is not a
temporal success criterion.

The query scopes are distinct. `Phi_syn` is the literal-negation grammar
generated by `literal ::= atom | !atom` and
`formula ::= literal | formula & formula | F(formula) | X(formula) |
formula U formula`. The validator rejects negation over a compound formula, so
`!(F(a0))` and `!!a0` are outside `Phi_syn`. `Phi_ach` is the atemporal
literal-and-conjunction subset. Its formula `psi` is written without a temporal
operator in the persisted query specification and embedded as `F(psi)` for execution. The
remaining formulae are TEGs. `Phi_bench` is the TEG family generated
from the five registered formula profiles. `Phi_cert(D, M_D)` is the subset of
validated bound formulas whose required distance-reducing DFA obligations pass
all compiler certification checks. Parsing establishes only `Phi_syn` membership;
query soundness is conditional on `Phi_cert`, and the reported TEG experiment is
over `Phi_bench`.

For a fixed bound query, proposition valuation is exact. If `mu_q(a)` is a
predicate atom, `a` is true in state `s` exactly when applying `theta_q` yields a
ground fact in the Boolean state. If `mu_q(a)` is `f(args)=c`, `a` is true
exactly when the bound ground function has integer value `c` in `s`. Domain
constants are not replaced by `theta_q`.

For a non-empty trace `xi=s_0...s_n`, strong next requires a successor position;
`xi,i |= X phi` iff `i<n` and `xi,i+1 |= phi`. Eventually requires some
`j` in `[i,n]` satisfying its operand. Strong Until requires some `j` in
`[i,n]` satisfying the right operand and every position in `[i,j)` satisfying
the left operand. These clauses justify singleton initial-state traces and the
prohibition on inserting a synthetic noop.

The validation module uses four independent gates:

1. **Prediction contract validation** checks the exact eight-key model payload,
   LTLf syntax, literal-only negation and operator fragment, atom-table closure,
   catalogue vocabulary, arity, subtype-compatible parameters, domain constants,
   and bounded integer numeric equalities. It never repairs a response. A
   model-correctable failure receives one stable `TranslationErrorCode`; an
   infrastructure failure is recorded separately.
2. **DFA language equivalence** first alpha-normalizes gold and predicted atom
   tables by their PDDL semantic identity, for example
   `(predicate,on,(X,Y),null)`, then invokes real LTLf2DFA/MONA on both
   formulas. It explores the reachable product automaton over the complete
   joint Boolean alphabet. If one DFA accepts and the other rejects, the
   shortest discovered valuation sequence is persisted as a counterexample
   witness. Equality is semantic, not textual: `F(a & b)` and `F(b & a)`
   pass when their atom tables denote the same PDDL atoms.
3. **Hidden witness validation** grounds the accepted prediction with
   `theta_i`, replays every primitive action in `pi_i` from the initial state,
   checks the sealed state fingerprints, and requires both gold and predicted
   DFAs to accept the resulting non-empty finite state trace. This is a data and
   grounding consistency check; it does not replace language equivalence,
   because an incorrectly weak formula may also hold on one witness.
4. **Execution-trace validation** replays the Jason-exported primitive action
   trace under the parsed PDDL action schemas. VAL receives a generated copy of
   `P_i` in which only the original goal is replaced by the true empty
   conjunction `(:goal (and))`, so VAL checks action legality without imposing
   the unrelated achievement goal. The replayed state sequence must then be
   accepted by the sealed gold DFA and the predicted DFA. End-to-end success
   requires PDDL replay, VAL, gold acceptance, and prediction acceptance.

The batch input is the 475-row `translation_predictions.jsonl`. Its results are
expanded through the sealed worklist membership to all 1,228 problem rows. The
validator writes separate translation-level and problem-level JSONL reports,
an aggregate summary, optional execution-level evidence, and one validated
append dataset per domain. A translation enters an append dataset only after
payload validation, exact DFA equivalence, and hidden-witness acceptance.

The exact DFA product is bounded by a declared maximum Boolean alphabet size,
not by a domain or predicate name. Benchmark version 1 uses at most three
temporal atoms per query. Exceeding the configured bound, MONA timeout, missing
VAL, malformed sealed audit data, and PDDL replay disagreement fail closed as
infrastructure or benchmark-consistency outcomes; they are never relabelled as
model semantic errors.

### Canonical TEG Benchmark Dataset

The repository tracks the frozen release at
`paper_artifacts/temporal_goal_benchmark/v1`. Its single canonical
`benchmark.json` contains 16 domain partitions and 1,228 problem-level cases.
A problem-level case is one tuple `(D, P_i, q_i, T_hat_i, theta_i)`: `D` is the
PDDL domain, `P_i` is the held-out initial state, `q_i` is the controlled query,
`T_hat_i` is the model-predicted lifted LTLf that passed exact language
equivalence, and `theta_i` is the sealed typed binding used for this problem.
The hidden oracle `T_i`, witness actions, and witness states are not copied into
the released case.

The bundle reports two evaluation units without conflating them. The 475
unique translation inputs are the macro unit for model translation accuracy.
The 1,228 expanded problem bindings are the micro unit for witness replay and
grounding consistency. Expansion through `member_sample_ids` does not create
additional model calls. The tracked result is 475/475 exact DFA-language
equivalence and 1,228/1,228 hidden-witness acceptance.

The 16 files under `domains/` are derived operational views, not separate
benchmarks. They exist because the temporal appender consumes one domain at a
time and every domain maintains one AgentSpeak library. The aggregate bundle
records each view's SHA-256, and the release manifest records the aggregate
bundle SHA-256. Consistently renaming PDDL symbols changes only corresponding
case symbols; benchmark generation contains no domain-name, action-name, or
fluent-name dispatch rule.

Execution evaluation remains a separate stage. A case is not an end-to-end
success until query append, Jason execution, primitive PDDL replay, independent
VAL under the neutral goal, gold-DFA acceptance, and predicted-DFA acceptance
all pass. The frozen version-1 release records execution as `not_attempted`.
Future execution failures are reported by domain and formula profile and do not
retroactively change the translation or witness metrics.

Each problem-level execution is one externally bound invocation. Before DFA
guard atoms enter the query-local AgentSpeak wrapper, the compiler substitutes
the case binding `theta_i`, for example `on(X,Y)` under `{X:b1,Y:b4}` becomes
the wrapper subgoal `!on(b1,b4)`. The atomic domain module remains lifted as
`+!on(X,Y)`; only the query wrapper is grounded. The runner rejects any mismatch
between the released binding and the sealed construction-audit assignment.

The paper execution entry point is
`scripts/run_temporal_goal_benchmark_execution.sh`. It consumes a complete
timestamped atomic-library batch without retraining MOOSE, compiles every case
independently, and records query compilation, Jason, PDDL replay, neutral-goal
VAL, gold-DFA, and predicted-DFA outcomes separately. Unsupported DFA structure
and missing required witnesses are structured compiler rejections rather than Jason
failures. Results are aggregated by domain and formula profile. The public
record retains case outcomes and validation statuses; verbose DFA, Jason,
trace, and validator files remain local diagnostics.

The planning model uses instantaneous deterministic typed STRIPS actions and
fully observable states. Conditional effects, durative actions, stochastic
outcomes, and partial observability are outside the certified fragment and fail
closed. The supported planning fragment also includes bounded integer resources.
A numeric resource is a declared PDDL function with an integer value in the
state, for example `(capacity ?vehicle)` or `(pogo_sticks_to_make)`. A numeric
resource context is rendered as a mutable AgentSpeak belief plus comparison,
for example `capacity(V,N) & N > 0`. A numeric resource goal is rendered with
the target value as the final achievement-goal argument, for example
`+!pogo_sticks_to_make(0)`. Numeric macro evidence is accepted only when the
PDDL schema validates the primitive action sequence and the macro has a unit
monotone numeric effect toward the target, for example
`craft_wooden_pogo; !pogo_sticks_to_make(0)` after a `decrease` effect on
`pogo_sticks_to_make`.

The producible target universe does not disappear when backend evidence contains
only a numeric goal. Every declared predicate occurring in a positive PDDL add
effect is a producible fluent and enters the same schema candidate generation and
Clingo selection. Predicates with no add or delete effect remain static context;
delete-only dynamic predicates remain non-producible. This
ensures, for example, that a numeric resource policy can coexist with lifted
`+!position(X)` and `+!air_cell(X)` modules derived from their schemas without
recognizing those names. The compiler metadata already labels each omitted
producible fluent as a coverage gap; the implementation therefore treats such
an omission as an invalid incomplete library rather than a permitted numeric
special case.

The compiler does not use a domain-name switch and does not assign a whole
domain to a compiler class. The structural labels are plan-template-level
labels. A plan template is one AgentSpeak(L) plan branch, for example one
`+!at(X,Y) : ... <- ...` branch. A single domain library usually contains
several plan-template kinds at the same time.

| Plan-template kind | Meaning | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `already_true_plan_template` | The requested fluent is already true, so the plan body is empty except for rendered `true`. | `+!clear(X) : clear(X) <- true.` |
| `action_only_plan_template` | The body contains only primitive PDDL actions. This includes fixed backend macro evidence, where a macro is a fixed action sequence, not a new PDDL action. | Logistics `+!at(P,L)` may execute `load_truck; drive_truck; unload_truck`. Blocks `+!clear(X)` may execute `unstack(Y,X); put_down(Y)`. |
| `subgoal_decomposed_plan_template` | The body contains at least one internal AgentSpeak achievement subgoal such as `!clear(Y)`. | Blocks `+!on(X,Y)` may call `!clear(Y); !on(X,Y)` when `Y` is not clear. |
| `numeric_already_true_plan_template` | A bounded integer numeric-resource achievement is already at the requested target value. This kind follows the numeric target semantics, not the empty body alone. | `+!pogo_sticks_to_make(0) : pogo_sticks_to_make(N) & N == 0 <- true.` |
| `numeric_resource_progress_plan_template` | A bounded integer numeric-resource achievement executes a validated unit-progress macro and recursively asks for the same target value. | `+!pogo_sticks_to_make(0) : pogo_sticks_to_make(N) & N > 0 <- craft_wooden_pogo; !pogo_sticks_to_make(0).` |

The metadata reports a library profile such as `mixed_atomic_template_library`
when several plan-template kinds appear in one domain library. This profile is
diagnostic only; it is not a domain taxonomy and is not used for routing.

## MOOSE Evidence and Compiler Responsibilities

The MOOSE module and the compiler module have different responsibilities. The
MOOSE module is the external evidence provider: it trains on singleton-goal
PDDL problems and emits a readable first-order decision list through
`policy --dump-policy`. A readable policy rule contains a lifted-looking state
condition, one singleton goal condition, and a primitive action macro. For
example, a Depots rule may say that under state facts such as
`at(crate0, depot0)`, `at(hoist0, depot0)`, and `clear(pallet0)`, the singleton
goal `on(crate0, pallet0)` can be achieved by a macro ending in
`drop(hoist0, crate0, pallet0, depot0)`.

The compiler module is the post-MOOSE, pre-AgentSpeak component. It consumes
the readable policy as evidence, checks it against the PDDL domain schema, adds
internal atomic modules from the producible target universe and action-schema-derived
precondition support, places
both evidence macros and action-schema-derived branches in one generated
certified candidate set, runs one Clingo/ASP selection, and renders the final AgentSpeak(L)
library. A
PDDL domain schema is the declared predicate and action model, for example
Depots `drop(?hoist, ?crate, ?surface, ?place)` with preconditions such as
`lifting(?hoist, ?crate)`, `clear(?surface)`, `at(?hoist, ?place)`, and
`at(?surface, ?place)`, and an add effect `on(?crate, ?surface)`.

MOOSE is the only implemented and experimentally evaluated Evidence Module
provider. `PolicyEvidenceProgram` is an extension interface: another provider
may be added later if its adapter emits the same normalized singleton-goal
rules and passes the same PDDL-derived checks. This interface does not imply that
another provider has already been reproduced or has MOOSE-equivalent results.

### MOOSE Parameter Provenance

MOOSE-native settings and our compiler settings are reported separately. The
MOOSE paper provides the following settings:

- `num_permutations = 3` is the default effort parameter in Algorithm 1. It is
  the maximum number of goal orderings sampled per training problem.
- `goal_max_size = 1` is our configuration flag that enforces the paper algorithm's
  singleton-goal step, where each relaxed subproblem has goal `{g_k}`. It is
  not a compactness threshold for the final ASL library.
- Generalized-plan synthesis receives 12 hours and 32 GB and is repeated five
  times in the paper.
- Test-time planning receives 1800 seconds and 8 GB. Up to five trained MOOSE
  models correspond to the five synthesis repetitions.

The batch runner defaults to 43200 seconds for MOOSE training and 1800 seconds
for MOOSE test-time planning. The paper protocol now executes five independent
synthesis repetitions with fixed seeds `0, 1, 2, 3, 4`. Each repetition trains
on the complete selected train split and has exactly one internal MOOSE worker.
This single-worker restriction is a reproducibility choice, not a MOOSE method
parameter: the current MOOSE implementation seeds one process-global random
generator and calls goal-permutation sampling from problem threads, so changing
thread scheduling can change which problem receives each random draw.

The five seed repetitions may run concurrently as isolated operating-system
processes because they share only read-only PDDL/backend inputs and use separate
model, policy, library, and log roots. A same-seed Logistics `p03` smoke test
produced the same 27-rule canonical policy hash in two concurrent isolated
processes with one internal worker; seeds 0 and 1 produced different canonical
policies on the same instance. This smoke test motivates process isolation but
is not treated as a proof over all domains. Every completed repetition therefore
records raw and canonical policy hashes so same-seed reproducibility remains
auditable.

Each seed policy is compiled and evaluated independently. Policies, rules, and
ASL branches are never concatenated across seeds, and the evaluation never
selects the best seed. Jason/VAL repetitions run sequentially across seeds to
avoid cross-seed resource contention changing timeout outcomes. The runner
default remains six per-test workers; the frozen submission runs explicitly use
eight, as recorded in every summary. Reports retain every seed result and
summarize coverage with the mean and sample standard deviation across completed
repetitions. Concurrent synthesis timings are throughput measurements; runtime
claims against another system require a separately controlled non-contented
timing run.

The canonical entry point is `scripts/run_parser_order_full_val_batch.sh`.
Without positional domain arguments it reads all 16 selected domain identifiers
from `src/benchmark_registry/achievement_goals/registry.json`. Within each seed,
`run_moose_faithful_e2e.py` traverses domains sequentially and passes
`--num_workers 1` to every MOOSE training call. Across seeds, the shell runner
starts at most five isolated processes by default. After synthesis, it validates
the complete test split for one seed at a time and writes
`five_seed_summary.json` with raw policy hashes, alpha-normalized rule-set
hashes, compiled-library hashes, per-seed coverage, mean coverage, and sample
standard deviation.

The repository-wide external-process guard remains 16 GiB; this is a declared
reproduction deviation from the paper's 32-GB synthesis ceiling.
`num_workers`, outer seed-process parallelism, full-split flags such as
`num_training = -1`, policy-dump and ASL append timeouts, Jason timeout, and VAL
timeout are pipeline or hardware settings, not MOOSE method parameters.

The compiler's candidate-construction grammar is explicit but no longer has
an arbitrary primitive-action depth bound. It contains direct producers,
finite backward STRIPS regressions over acyclic producible-precondition
dependencies, and optional causal resource-mode discharge paths. Backward
regression replaces an open requirement by the selected action's preconditions
and rejects a step when its delete effects contradict another open requirement.
An action's still-unbound parameters are first unified with compatible open
positive requirements; only parameters that remain unbound receive fresh
variables. Search terminates by forbidding a repeated alpha-normalized
requirement/producer step and retaining only the shortest body for an equivalent
requirement and conditional module-completion summary. This search is enabled only when
the producer-precondition predicate graph reachable from the target is acyclic.
Cyclic targets rely on validated provider macros and separately certified
recursive modules rather than an unrestricted instance-level planner.

Removing this acyclic gate is not an accepted fallback. Alpha-normalized cycle
blocking makes the signature space finite but can still enumerate a
combinatorial number of lifted requirement sets. A real Logistics probe exceeded
600 seconds under that experimental configuration, whereas the retained
acyclic compiler completed in seconds. Cyclic producer dependencies therefore
require an evidence-guided mode path or a separately proved lexicographic
ranking witness before they enter the supported compiler fragment.

Resource-mode discharge separately searches a finite symbolic mode graph and
forbids repeated alpha-normalized resource modes. Consequently, a schema
candidate may contain more than five actions, but every accepted path is finite
and symbolically replayed. A validated Evidence Module macro is also never
truncated. Clingo optimality remains only within this generated certified
candidate set. These are structural scope restrictions, not domain-name
rules and not MOOSE parameters.

The compiler therefore does not simply rename objects from training instances
into variables. It may add an internal module when the target action's
precondition names a producible fluent. A producible fluent is a predicate that
appears in some positive add effect, for example Depots `lifting(H,C)` or
Blocks `clear(X)`. A static context predicate is a predicate that never appears
in positive add/delete effects, for example Logistics `in-city(L,C)`; it can
bind context but must not become a `+!in_city(...)` achievement module.

### Range-Safe Precondition Lifting

Range-safe precondition lifting is the current general fix for producer actions
whose useful preconditions contain variables not present in the requested goal
head. Range-safe means every non-head variable is bound by positive context
facts before the compiler turns the precondition into an internal subgoal.

Before this fix, the compiler could emit the direct producer branch below, but
it would usually not emit the repair branch for the missing `lifting(Z,X)`
precondition because `Z` is not an argument of the head goal `on(X,Y)`:

```asl
+!on(X, Y) :
	clear(Y) & crate(X) & surface(Y) & at(Y, A) & place(A) &
	at(Z, A) & hoist(Z) & lifting(Z, X) <-
	drop(Z, X, Y, A).
```

This branch is correct only when the hoist is already lifting the target crate.
If `lifting(Z,X)` is false, Jason cannot use this branch and the library may
fall back to a much longer MOOSE macro or fail to repair the missing condition.

After the fix, the same PDDL schema also justifies a prepare branch:

```asl
+!on(X, Y) :
	clear(Y) & crate(X) & surface(Y) & at(Y, A) & place(A) &
	at(Z, A) & hoist(Z) & not lifting(Z, X) <-
	!lifting(Z, X);
	!on(X, Y).
```

The important part is the binding proof for `Z`: `at(Z,A) & hoist(Z)` binds
the hoist variable, while `at(Y,A) & place(A)` connects the hoist's place to
the target surface. The rule is not Depots-specific; it is generated from the
producer action's positive preconditions and add effect. The same mechanism
applies to any domain where a producer action needs an extra witness object,
provided that witness is range-restricted by positive context.

The fix is intentionally conservative. The compiler still refuses to turn an
extra-variable relation into an achievement subgoal if the extra variables can
only be introduced by a negative literal, by a static relation with no dynamic
anchor, or by an unrelated context fact. This avoids unsafe plans such as
asking Jason to achieve a relation over an unbound object.

### Well-Founded Relational Progress

A same-predicate recursive preparation branch is admitted only when the
compiler can construct a non-negative feature from a fixed structural grammar.
A ranking feature is compile-time metadata, not a new ASL fluent. The first
feature is a global relational count. For example, for `+!clear(X)` the schema
can induce `count(on)`, meaning the
number of currently true atoms of the dynamic predicate used as the obstruction
relation. The generated `unstack; put-down` sequence deletes one `on` atom and
does not add any `on` atom, so the feature strictly decreases and is bounded
below by zero.

The second feature is an anchor-local relation count under an acyclicity
assumption. For anchor `X`, it counts facts of the form `relation(Z,X)`. A
sequence may remove `relation(Z,X)` and add `relation(Z,B)`: the global count
does not fall, but the anchor-local count falls when schema-derived guards prove
`B != X`. Acyclicity prevents recursive calls from returning to an earlier
anchor. The candidate is selected only if every reachable internal module
preserves this decrease. The implementation metadata retains the internal label
`anchored_acyclic_relation_cone_count`; the paper uses the explicit count.

Concretely, if one transition requires `supports(a,b)` and `supports(b,c)`, the
support-depth order builds `supports(b,c)` first and then `supports(a,b)`. The
assumption excludes any reachable cycle such as `supports(a,b) & supports(b,a)`:
with a cycle there is no finite bottom support from which recursive progress can
be ranked. The predicate name is irrelevant; the same test passes after
renaming the relation and every action in the PDDL domain.

Deleting one obstruction is not sufficient by itself. Clingo jointly selects
the cross-predicate preparation graph and relation-preserving action branches.
Cross-predicate preparation edges must form a directed acyclic graph. Each
selected edge receives natural-number caller and callee ranks with
`caller_rank > callee_rank`, while its local negative precondition guard falls
from unsatisfied to satisfied before the original target is retried.
Same-predicate recursion is exempt from this predicate-rank rule only when it
has the separate relational-decrease witness above.

Relation threats are evaluated over this selected preparation graph, not the
larger raw candidate graph. A branch such
as `unstack; stack`, which exchanges one `on` atom for another, cannot coexist
with recursion certified by the global `count(on)`. For an anchored cone,
the compiler composes final PDDL effects and permits a relation add only when
the branch trigger maps the same anchor argument and its guards prove that the
new anchor differs from the protected anchor. The query compiler independently
rechecks the same selected preparation edges and anchored effect condition from
the final library rather than trusting metadata alone.
Navigation recursion such as moving
between two rooms deletes and re-adds one location fluent, so no strict count
decrease is available and that recursion is not selected. Predicate names and
argument positions are not consulted; the feature and action effects come from
the PDDL schema.

### Target-Preserving Keyed Resource-Mode Discharge

For candidate branch `b`, the formal resource object is the finite graph
`G_b^res=(V_b^res,E_b^res)`. Each vertex is an alpha-normalized occupancy mode
keyed by a reusable-resource argument; each labelled edge is a symbolically
executable action-schema transition that preserves the atomic target. A
producer may move the resource from an availability mode into an occupied mode.
The branch is accepted only when a finite non-repeating path returns the same
key to an availability mode while the target remains true. For example, in
Depots the action `lift(H,C,S,P)` can achieve `clear(S)`, but it also creates
the occupied mode `lifting(H,C)` and deletes the availability mode
`available(H)`. If the library stops there, later goals may fail because the
hoist is still occupied.

The compiler accepts a finite discharge path only when the PDDL schema certifies
all of the following facts:

- each discharge edge deletes the current producer-created occupied mode without
  immediately re-adding it, and the terminal edge restores the consumed free
  mode; for example `drop(H,C,B,P)` deletes `lifting(H,C)` and restores
  `available(H)`;
- the producer consumes a key-only free mode and creates a key-plus-occupant
  occupied mode, while the discharge performs the inverse transition. For example,
  `available(H)` supplies key `H`, while `lifting(H,C)` adds occupant `C`;
- the occupancy predicate is not merely a same-predicate property moved by the
  producer, so `clear(Y)` created by `unstack(X,Y)` is not treated as a held
  resource;
- every extra discharge variable is range-restricted by positive context facts,
  for example a parking surface `B` must satisfy `surface(B)`, `at(B,P)`, and
  `clear(B)`;
- if the discharge action could delete the protected target, the compiler emits a
  Jason non-unification guard such as `B \== S`.

Before this rule, a generated `+!clear(S)` branch in Depots could stop after
lifting the obstructing crate:

```asl
+!clear(S) :
	surface(S) & on(C, S) & clear(C) & at(C, P) &
	at(H, P) & available(H) <-
	lift(H, C, S, P).
```

This branch achieves `clear(S)`, but it leaves `lifting(H,C)` true and
`available(H)` false. After the rule, the compiler can emit a certified
resource-discharge branch:

```asl
+!clear(S) :
	surface(S) & on(C, S) & clear(C) & at(C, P) &
	at(H, P) & available(H) &
	surface(B) & at(B, P) & clear(B) & B \== S <-
	lift(H, C, S, P);
	drop(H, C, B, P).
```

This is still not a domain-name patch. The same rule would also accept a
Blocks-style `unstack; put-down` discharge, because `unstack(B,S)` creates
`holding(B)` and deletes `handempty`, while `put-down(B)` deletes
`holding(B)` and restores zero-arity `handempty`. The rule rejects the reverse
shape, such as turning `available(H)` back into `lifting(H,C)`, because that is
resource acquisition rather than resource discharge.

The key-plus-occupant condition is not treated as an arity shortcut. It is used
together with the paired precondition/add/delete effects to orient an otherwise
symmetric transition. If two same-shaped predicates can be swapped without
changing the schema, the compiler cannot know which mode denotes availability;
it rejects that discharge unless provider evidence or a future explicit
resource-role annotation supplies the missing orientation.

Multi-step discharge is supported when every intermediate mode carries the same
action-schema-derived capacity key and occupant roles, no normalized mode repeats,
every action is symbolically executable, and the final state preserves the
atomic target. The compiler also records the complete release-action path, not
only its final action. It does not yet synthesize a query-local restricted
portfolio for an overloaded producer predicate whose safe and unsafe branches
are distinguished only by untyped static roles. In the untyped Depots PDDL,
for example, `at/2` is produced by both `drive` and `drop`; schema syntax alone
does not prove that `truck(B)` and `crate(B)` are disjoint. If a recursive
resource preparation requires only the `drive` portfolio while `drop` would
increase a protected support cone, the compiler rejects that closure instead
of assuming role disjointness or recognizing either predicate name.

### Joint Certified Candidate Selection

Validated MOOSE macros and action-schema-derived modules are no longer selected in
separate phases. A validated MOOSE macro
is a readable-policy action sequence that replays through the PDDL action
schemas, for example a complete Logistics package-delivery macro
`load-truck; drive-truck; unload-truck`. A recursive repair branch is a branch
whose body calls internal subgoals, for example `!lifting(Z,X); !on(X,Y)`.

Each MOOSE macro is an evidence obligation in the same Clingo program that
selects direct producers, preparation branches, resource-discharge branches, and
validated bounded-integer numeric branches. Numeric-only evidence therefore no
longer bypasses Clingo. An evidence obligation is covered only by an
alpha-equivalent branch or an identical body under a weaker conjunctive context.
Separately, one action-schema producer obligation may be covered by a weaker-context
primitive producer only when its composed `MustAdd` set contains the required
target, its `MayDelete` set is no larger, and its `NumericDelta` and complete
parameterized resource-mode summaries are causally compatible. Summary
identity records both action names, but refinement may use a different discharge
action only when debt, restored literals, capacity/occupancy roles, target
preservation, and alias guards refine the obligation and the composed Boolean
and numeric effects introduce no new harm. Predicate-name
equality and body-prefix similarity are not semantic evidence coverage. In
particular, the current compiler does not yet prove that a short recursive
module is equivalent to an arbitrary long MOOSE macro. Clingo also enforces
internal-call closure, enforces an acyclic cross-predicate preparation graph,
and rejects selected relation producers reachable from a ranking root unless
their final effects preserve the certified anchored cone.

```asl
/* broad repair branch tried too early */
+!at(X, Y) : obj_tp(X, ball) & obj_tp(Y, room) & not at_robby(Y) <-
	!at_robby(Y);
	!at(X, Y).

/* complete macro exists but may be tried later */
+!at(X, Y) : at(X, A) & at_robby(A) & free(Z) <-
	pick(X, A, Z);
	move(A, Y);
	drop(X, Y).
```

After selection, already-true branches are rendered first. A producer macro
with a target-preserving causal resource-discharge certificate precedes a
shorter producer that would leave the resource occupied. A preparation branch
derived from that discharge path also precedes the outstanding-debt producer;
ordinary complete action-only macros still precede ordinary recursive repair
branches. This ordering changes neither branch contexts nor effects: an
inapplicable discharge branch is skipped by normal AgentSpeak context matching.

```asl
+!at(X, Y) : at(X, A) & at_robby(A) & free(Z) <-
	pick(X, A, Z);
	move(A, Y);
	drop(X, Y).

+!at(X, Y) : obj_tp(X, ball) & obj_tp(Y, room) & not at_robby(Y) <-
	!at_robby(Y);
	!at(X, Y).
```

The optimization is lexicographic. Hard schema/evidence/closure obligations
must first be satisfiable; then Clingo first maximizes relational recursive
capabilities with strict well-founded ranking witnesses, next maximizes compatible
acyclic precondition-discharge capabilities, and finally minimizes branch
count, context count, and body cost. The first priority reflects unbounded
structural generalization rather than a domain name or predicate name.
Optimality is claimed only within the generated certified candidate set, not
over all possible AgentSpeak programs.

### Current Alignment and Remaining Gap

The current implementation is aligned with the intended post-MOOSE compiler
role in these ways:

- MOOSE remains evidence, not the final library.
- Internal modules such as `clear`, `holding`, `lifting`, `available`, `at`,
  and `in` enter the producible target universe from PDDL add effects, while
  their required internal calls are enforced separately by internal-call
  closure.
- Static predicates remain context-only.
- The final ASL uses PDDL fluents and actions plus the reserved `obj_tp/2`
  type metadata; it must not emit `type_*` predicates.
- Clingo/ASP is the branch selector for compactness within the generated
  certified candidate set.

The current implementation supports finite acyclic protected resource-mode
discharge when every step is certified directly by PDDL preconditions and
effects. It is not complete for all parking cases. If a release path requires
an overloaded untyped producer to be restricted to one context-dependent
preserving branch set, or if every available discharge path would delete the
protected target without a representable non-unification guard, the compiler
rejects the branch rather than patching the domain by name.

### Ranked Cross-Module Precondition Repair

A producer action can require several dynamic preconditions that cannot all be
true at the same location or process stage. Requiring every sibling
precondition in the context of every preparation branch can therefore create a
deadlock. The compiler now projects an unrelated dynamic sibling out of one
preparation context only under all of these action-schema-derived conditions:

- the producer-precondition dependency graph is acyclic and traverses a
  schema-inferred single-valued fluent, such as one object's current location;
- every projected sibling has exactly one PDDL producer schema;
- the static preconditions of that producer remain in the context as
  feasibility witnesses;
- nested producer variables are alpha-renamed away from all outer variables;
- the branch recursively rechecks the original atomic target before its
  primitive producer can execute.

For example, an image producer may require both `calibrated(C,R)` and
`at(R,IW)`. Calibration itself may require visiting another waypoint. The
calibration repair branch may omit the current dynamic `at(R,IW)` requirement,
but it retains static facts establishing that `C` is on board `R`, supports the
requested mode, has a calibration target, and that suitable waypoints are
visible. After calibration, `!have_image(...)` is called again, so the final
primitive image action still requires the full original producer context.

If projection dependencies are cyclic, or a projected obligation has several
producer schemas, the candidate keeps the former full connected context. At
selection time, cross-predicate preparation branches are optional recursive
capabilities rather than mandatory evidence obligations. Clingo chooses an
acyclic subset and seals each selected branch with its caller/callee dependency
ranks. A cyclic subset is rejected; it is not retained as an unordered strongly
connected component. This is a fail-closed compositional rule, not arbitrary
schema planning.

### Certified DFA Guard Serialization

Every distance-reducing DFA progress edge is compiled into one query-local
`trans` helper guarded by the current runtime monitor state. A singleton
positive guard calls its atomic module once and
rechecks the guard, which is action-equivalent to the former linear call while
adding declarative completion checking. For a conjunctive guard, the compiler
computes conservative conditional may-add and may-delete summaries over the
final selected atomic module call graph. Every effect retains its branch's
positive, negative, equality, and disequality context. Effects are composed to
successful atomic-module completion, so a primitive add later deleted or a
delete later restored is represented by its completion polarity. The summary is a finite relational
fixed point: root query arguments remain symbolic anchors, newly introduced
module variables are alpha-normalized, and subgoal calls are expanded until no
new predicate/argument shape is reachable. It therefore covers parameter-changing recursion such as
`at(X,Y) -> carry(X,Z) -> at(X,Z)` without a domain-specific depth bound. PDDL
type constraints are part of unification, so deleting `at(Truck,L)` cannot
falsely threaten `at(Package,L)` when `truck` and `package` are disjoint sibling
types. Shared lifted variables retain one binding and the conjunction is
rejected if their declared type requirements are inconsistent. Single-valued
predicate invariants inferred from paired PDDL add/delete schemas also reject a
guard that requests two provably different values for the same key.

If achieving literal `G2` may delete literal `G1`, certification orders `G2`
before `G1`. Only literals on the same DFA transition may be reordered;
different transitions retain DFA order. The transition certificate records the
summary method as `pddl_typed_conditional_relational_fixed_point`, the ordered
literal indexes, all induced threat edges, the functional-invariant count, and
the `atomic_module_completion` observation boundary.

An acyclic threat graph uses universal topological serialization. For a cyclic
universal summary, the compiler may derive a candidate support-depth order:
every positive goal uses one binary relation with a compiler-generated
relational-decrease witness, the requested relation graph is functional and
acyclic, and supports can be ordered before dependants. That order alone does
not establish execution soundness. Every selected branch must also preserve all
earlier ranked achievements. A recursive repair is admitted only when it
discharges one explicit negative context obligation, its preparation module has
a complete summary, and its recursive self-call is rewritten to the enforced
query-local alias. This rule records the explicit paper assumption that the
relation is acyclic in every reachable execution state. It is a structural
assumption over PDDL effects and selected modules, not a domain or
predicate-name switch.

The enforced portfolio is selected per ordered literal occurrence, not once per
predicate symbol. A literal occurrence is one concrete position in the guard;
for example, `on(middle,lower)` and `on(upper,middle)` are two occurrences of
`on/2`. They have different protected prefixes after support-depth ordering, so
the compiler independently certifies which `+!on/2` branches preserve the
goals established before each position. Equivalent occurrence portfolios are
shared under one helper only after their selected branch-name sets coincide.
This prevents a branch unsafe for a late occurrence from globally removing a
recursive branch that is safe and necessary at an earlier occurrence. Plan
contexts such as `not clear(X)` and `not holding(X)` are alternative
applicability cases; the compiler does not incorrectly require one preparation
module to preserve every alternative context simultaneously. The transition
certificate therefore records selected branch names by literal index and reports
recursive closure only when at least one selected branch actually contains an
internal achievement call.

If the ranked portfolio cannot be certified, the compiler may instead enforce a
query-local preservation-safe action-only selection. An action-only branch is a selected
atomic plan whose body is a finite sequence of primitive PDDL actions and has no
internal achievement call. The compiler symbolically executes the whole branch,
keeps only branches whose conditional net deletes cannot unify with any sibling
goal and whose net adds cannot unify with any negative guard, copies those branches under a query-local helper trigger, and makes every
transition repair call the helper. Merely proving that a safe branch exists is
not enough: copying the branch is what prevents Jason from selecting an unsafe
sibling from the original atomic trigger. Ground object names are alpha-normalized
to typed equality-pattern representatives during this check, while domain
constants and shared query variables remain fixed. This is a proof-cost
optimization and does not merge objects that may be equal in execution. The
filter retains every certified safe action-only branch; it does not claim a new
minimum-branch optimization. If no non-empty safe branch remains, the cycle is
still rejected. Mixed Boolean/numeric guards use exact action-only net Boolean
effects and constant-integer numeric deltas. If repairing one literal changes a
sibling numeric fluent, the compiler adds the corresponding ordering threat.
Query-local helpers are indexed by complete literal atoms, so equal predicate
names with different arguments or values cannot overwrite one another. A
literal without a complete preserving action-only branch remains
observation-only and cannot fall back to an uncertified atomic trigger.
For example, `in(package,vehicle) & capacity(vehicle)=2` may call a certified
pickup branch first and observe the resulting capacity equality second. This is
a cross-literal preservation witness in the transition certificate, not a
completeness claim for arbitrary numeric planning.
For a positive numeric equality, the query compiler may additionally derive a
one-action progress branch directly from a PDDL numeric effect. A unit delta is
admitted only under a strict directional guard, such as `N>0` before a
decrement toward zero, so each replay is monotone. A non-unit delta is admitted
only at the exact predecessor value `target-delta`, which prevents overshoot.
If the action has an unsatisfied producible predicate precondition or a
constant-bounded numeric precondition, the query compiler may add a certified
preparation branch. Predicate preparation strictly reduces the number of
missing positive producer preconditions. Numeric preparation strictly reduces
the prerequisite deficit, leaves the target numeric fluent unchanged, and
preserves the producer's other preconditions. The resulting ranking is
lexicographic and is persisted in the candidate's certification record; no
fluent or action name is recognized.

For an Until source state, literals common to all waiting self-loop cubes are
source invariants. The current action-strategy fragment requires one positive
progress literal for such a state. Every selected action-only macro is checked
at each primitive prefix: a positive invariant cannot be deleted and a negative
invariant cannot be added before the progress literal is established. The final
establishing action may consume a source invariant because strong Until
requires the left operand only at earlier positions. For a multi-step numeric
target, repeatable steps instead carry action-schema-derived non-unification guards,
for example `Other \== Protected`, while a step that must consume the protected
object is restricted to the exact predecessor value. A query-local numeric base
case observes the target equality and terminates recursive preparation.

All query-local composition uses capture-avoiding substitution. Atomic-plan
local variables are alpha-renamed away from both query variables and variables
owned by an outer producer before contexts and bodies are combined. This
prevents accidental constraints such as `Y \== Y` or one symbol being required
to denote both a store and a waypoint.
If independently summarized branches induce a conservative cycle, one
primitive action may replace that serialization only when symbolic execution
proves that its complete net effect establishes every Boolean and numeric
literal in the guard. This is a joint guard-establishment certificate, not a
domain-specific numeric operator or an unrestricted arithmetic planner.
The query-local helper is callable from every positive guard literal established
by that action. Every call carries the complete anchor argument tuple used by
the binding witness. Therefore an already-satisfied first literal
cannot make the action unreachable while another established sibling remains
false, and a sibling with fewer arguments cannot silently drop a query binding.
It never falls back to parser order or a monotonic step-helper path. Negative
guard literals remain context checks and are never converted into negative
achievement subgoals.

For negative predicates, the transition certificate records fail-closed
preservation and establishment witnesses. For a guard
such as `delivered(P) & not damaged(P)`, every feasible conditional `MayAdd`
effect of the selected `!delivered(P)` module is type-unified with
`damaged(P)`. A branch that may add the forbidden atom cannot enter the
unfiltered transition. The compiler either enforces a query-local action-only
selection containing only goal-achieving branches that preserve positive
siblings and negative guards, or raises `negative_guard_not_preserved` before
ASL rendering. The transition certificate records the concrete negative
literals, preservation status, selected branch names, and the
`atomic_module_completion` observation boundary. Predicate/action renaming and
PDDL sibling types do not alter this rule.

When a forbidden atom is present, the appender may repair its absence through
either a positive sibling's finite action-only branch or a directly matched
single PDDL action. Both cases require an exact net `MustDelete`, preservation
of every positive sibling, and no completion `MayAdd` for any forbidden atom.
For a progress edge whose target is accepting, the same helper first tries any
schema-certified single action whose complete net effects satisfy every signed
guard obligation. If that action is inapplicable, Jason continues with all
pre-existing partial deleters in their original order. This accepting-edge
dominance rule is deliberately not applied to non-accepting edges, where an
alternative complete repair could change the state available to later temporal
obligations. The rule uses typed unification and complete PDDL effects, never a
domain, predicate, or action name.
Extra action parameters must be range-restricted by positive PDDL preconditions
or `obj_tp/2`. Free deleter parameters are first unified with compatible
positive-sibling add effects. Thus a relocation action whose delete binds the
origin and whose add binds the requested destination can establish
`at(destination) & not at(origin)` without leaving the destination variable
unconstrained. For example, an arbitrary action that adds `holding(H,C)` and
deletes `available(H)` certifies `holding(h,c) & not available(h)`; a
negative-only `not active(x)` may use a generic `deactivate(x)` schema for the
same reason. No predicate or action name is recognized by the algorithm. If no
establisher exists, the signed negative leaf succeeds only when the atom is
already absent rather than inventing a negative subgoal.

A negative-only edge succeeds when the atom is absent and may call only the
single-action `MustDelete` helper described above when it is present. No
`!not_p(...)` achievement is synthesized, and no waiting for exogenous deletion
is implied. Temporary addition followed by deletion before atomic-module return
is permitted by the completion summary. Negated numeric equality is checked by
the runtime monitor; without a certified numeric change-away branch it remains
observation-only rather than being rejected as malformed LTLf.

After certification fixes an order `L1, ..., Ln`, the appender prepends signed
negative obligations and compiles the result into a balanced binary
transition-repair tree. A balanced binary transition-repair tree is
query-local AgentSpeak control structure: an internal helper for range `[i,j]`
calls the two midpoint ranges. A positive leaf checks or achieves `Li`; a
negative leaf checks `not N` and, when available, calls only its certified
`MustDelete(N)` helper. The root then calls a separate done helper. The done
helper runs only after the root has completed one full left-to-right repair pass.
It re-enters the same transition only while the exact runtime monitor still
reports its source state; otherwise it returns and the top-level dispatcher
follows the actual DFA state. Source-state exit does not interrupt an already
invoked atomic module or short-circuit the remaining tree ranges. This matters
when one atomic macro contains several primitive actions and crosses several
DFA edges before returning: requiring the immediately adjacent target state
would incorrectly replay a transition that has already completed.

The post-exit suffix remains fail-closed. Each remaining leaf either observes a
signed literal or calls only its preselected certified repair. An applicable
repair is PDDL-executable and preserves the established signed prefix at module
return; an unavailable repair fails without inserting a replacement action.
Every primitive suffix action is consumed by the runtime DFA, so the suffix may
cross further actual edges, including a rejecting edge, but cannot fabricate a
transition or report false acceptance. This is trace safety, not a claim that
the suffix is a complete strategy for the newly reached state. Thus balancing
changes how Jason dispatches a certified serialization, not which serialization
or temporal semantics is used.

A direct linear realization would invoke the same certified leaves in the same
order, but one transition plan would contain all `N` leaf calls plus the done
check. Parsing and storing that monolithic plan, and constructing and resuming
its intention continuation, would therefore remain dependent on guard size.
Midpoint decomposition changes only this representation: every generated
controller plan has at most two body steps while preserving the same ordered
leaf sequence.

This replaces the old one-sibling-plan-per-literal representation. For `N`
positive literals, that representation gave one trigger `N` repair candidates
and could repeat that candidate scan after each repair, yielding quadratic
controller matching. The balanced tree has `O(N)` query-local nodes, maximum
trigger fan-out two, maximum plan-body length two, `O(N)` visits per pass, and
`O(log N)` nesting depth. The
exact runtime monitor is consulted through the source-state completion belief
after each pass. The compiler records
`transition_controller_strategy=monitored_balanced_repair_tree` so experiments
cannot silently mix the two encodings. Tree helper names are not PDDL fluents,
atomic modules, or exported actions.

For a singleton transition, the tree has one leaf: if the literal is absent it
calls the same atomic module once, and the done helper checks whether the exact
monitor left the source state. It is therefore primitive-action equivalent to
the previous singleton wrapper when the module crosses one edge, while also
remaining correct when one macro crosses multiple edges.
For several DFA progress transitions, one independently generated tree is used
per distance-reducing edge; the current runtime monitor state selects applicable
dispatch plans. The tree does not provide action batching, make an uncertified
threat cycle safe, or make action-strategy synthesis complete.

The execution environment advances the real deterministic finite automaton
after the initial valuation and after every successful primitive PDDL action.
It updates query-local monitor-state and accepting beliefs used by the top-level
AgentSpeak controller. These beliefs are controller interface state, not domain
fluents and not exported actions. Before transition-certificate construction, the
converter expands the DFA's Boolean transition relation into separate
conjunctive transition records. This is a representation normalization rather
than rejection of Boolean alternatives: the runtime monitor still evaluates
the complete DFA transition relation. Same-source/same-target records are
grouped only by a common achievement objective established during
certification. Consequently a strong-until formula detects an
intermediate violation even when an atomic macro later restores the fluent.
This gives exact trace observation for the declared `F`, `X`, `U`, conjunction,
and literal-negation fragment. It does not prove that the generated action
strategy solves every satisfiable PDDL-times-LTLf product; missing certified
progress actions remain execution failure or timeout outcomes.

## Benchmark Scope

The MOOSE paper evaluates eight classical ESHO domains for synthesis cost:
`barman`, `ferry`, `gripper`, `logistics`, `miconic`, `rovers`, `satellite`,
and `transport`. It then adds four numeric domains for instantiation-cost and
solution-quality experiments: `numeric-ferry`, `numeric-miconic`,
`numeric-minecraft`, and `numeric-transport`. The official companion source is
`DillonZChen/moose-dataset` at commit
`e00970516154e9042b783a4613a1ed7286c9beee`; in that source, those twelve
domains have both non-empty `training/` and non-empty `testing/` directories.

We therefore materialize every MOOSE direct train/test domain, including the
numeric domains, plus the project-added feature-definable serialized-width
benchmarks needed for the internal-module part of the plan-library claim. The
taxonomy below uses literature-level properties rather than task-story labels.
MOOSE is a source of evidence and benchmark provenance, not the taxonomy itself
and not the name of the compiler module.

| Group | Domains | Shared property |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ESHO classical domains | `barman`, `ferry`, `gripper`, `logistics`, `miconic`, `rovers`, `satellite`, `transport` | Classical PDDL domains in the easy-to-solve, hard-to-optimise benchmark family used by MOOSE following the Helmert-style complexity view. These domains are suitable for testing whether singleton-goal regression evidence can be lifted into reusable atomic AgentSpeak(L) modules. |
| Numeric fluent domains | `numeric-ferry`, `numeric-miconic`, `numeric-minecraft`, `numeric-transport` | PDDL domains whose state, action applicability, or goals include numeric functions, numeric conditions, or numeric effects. They are included for benchmark coverage and for the bounded integer numeric-resource compiler fragment. |
| Feature-definable serialized-width domains | `blocksworld-clear`, `blocksworld-on`, `blocksworld-tower`, `depots` | Relational planning-family entries whose compact reusable behavior is normally expressed through lifted features and serialized subgoal structure: a feature-defined policy or sketch selects progress-making subgoals whose induced subproblems have small width. This group tests whether the compiler can add justified internal atomic modules from PDDL schemas rather than merely replay fixed singleton macros. |

Here a benchmark entry may be a planning-family entry rather than a unique PDDL
dynamics file. `blocksworld-clear` and `blocksworld-on` share Blocksworld-style
dynamics but differ in the lifted singleton goal family: the former is the
`QClear` family with goals such as `clear(X)`, and the latter is the `QOn`
family with goals such as `on(X,Y)`. `blocksworld-tower` is the classical typed
Blocksworld arrangement family, where multiple support literals interact and
must be serialized. This naming follows prior general-policy and planning-width
work on `QClear`, `QOn`, and full Blocksworld; it is not an implementation
route or a duplicate-counting trick.

The formal local corpus lives under `src/domains/<domain>/` with
`domain.pddl`, `train/*.pddl`, `test/*.pddl`, and `source.json`.

Materialization also checks referential PDDL validity. Every problem's
`(:domain ...)` declaration is compared with the actual copied `domain.pddl`
declaration and, when an upstream companion release retains an obsolete alias,
is normalized to the actual declaration. The number of normalized files is
recorded in `source.json`. This is a syntax-level, symbol-independent corpus
repair applied to every domain; predicates, actions, initial states, goals, and
split membership are unchanged. Validators do not silently accept mismatched
domain references.

The current split policy is:

| Domains | Split policy |
| --- | --- |
| All twelve MOOSE direct train/test domains | MOOSE official companion split: source `training/` as train and source `testing/` as test. |
| `blocksworld-clear`, `blocksworld-on` | KR 2025 learner-policies no-constants split: source `learning/benchmarks/tractable/<family>/training/easy` as train and source `testing/benchmarks/<family>` as test. |
| `blocksworld-tower` | Project feature-definable serialized-width split: `floor(1/4 * instance_count)` train and remaining instances as test. |
| `depots` | Project small-instance feature-definable serialized-width split: `floor(1/2 * instance_count)` train and remaining instances as test. The D2L source has 22 instances, so the larger train side gives MOOSE and the post-MOOSE compiler broader stacking/transport evidence before held-out testing. |

## Domain Evidence Notes

The following notes describe which goal structures each benchmark stresses.
They are not compiler-outcome assignments.

| Domain | Group | Evidence note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `barman` | ESHO classical domains | Beverage goals such as `contains(Shot,Cocktail)` exercise cleaning, filling, pouring, shaking, and container state. |
| `ferry` | ESHO classical domains | Car-location goals such as `at(C,L)` exercise lifted ferry-loading and sailing actions. |
| `gripper` | ESHO classical domains | Ball-location goals such as `at(B,R)` exercise repeated lifted object movement over balls and grippers. |
| `logistics` | ESHO classical domains | Package-location goals exercise long intermodal macros over trucks, airplanes, packages, cities, and locations. |
| `miconic` | ESHO classical domains | Passenger service goals such as `served(P)` exercise boarding, lift movement, and departure; static floor-order predicates such as `above(F1,F2)` remain context only. |
| `rovers` | ESHO classical domains | Communication goals such as `communicated_rock_data(W)` exercise sampling, imaging, calibration, and sending data. |
| `satellite` | ESHO classical domains | Pointing and image goals such as `have_image(D,M)` exercise instrument power, calibration, turning, and imaging. |
| `transport` | ESHO classical domains | Package-location goals such as `at(P,L)` exercise capacity-aware vehicle loading, driving, and dropping. |
| `numeric-ferry` | Numeric fluent domains | Numeric variant of ferry-style car-location goals, included to test numeric evidence import. |
| `numeric-miconic` | Numeric fluent domains | Numeric variant of miconic service goals, included to test numeric evidence import. |
| `numeric-minecraft` | Numeric fluent domains | Numeric resource-production goals such as reducing `pogo_sticks_to_make` to zero exercise non-predicate goal semantics. |
| `numeric-transport` | Numeric fluent domains | Numeric variant of transport package-location goals, included to test numeric evidence import. |
| `blocksworld-clear` | Feature-definable serialized-width domains | KR 2025 `QClear` family. Atomic `clear(X)` goals exercise recursive obstruction removal and internal modules such as `holding(X)`, `handempty`, and `ontable(X)`. |

## Unsupported Boundary

The official `*-axioms` and `*-disjpres` companion directories are not default
training benchmarks because the companion dataset provides only `testing/`
problems for them. They remain useful as future robustness probes after the base
train/test domains are stable.

`8puzzle-1tile` is not in the formal benchmark scope. The current compiler can
handle validated singleton macro evidence and feature-definable serialized-width
action-schema-derived candidates, but `8puzzle-1tile` requires graph-search and
permutation-progress reasoning:
placing one tile depends on moving the blank through a grid while preserving
solvability constraints. That structure needs a graph-search controller,
planning program, or a separate ranking witness before it can be
compiled into a compact AgentSpeak(L) atomic library. Until then, the correct
result is `unsupported_by_current_compiler`, not a domain-specific patch.

The same boundary applies to any domain or goal whose reusable atomic module
requires a recursive progress or ranking argument that the compiler cannot
derive from the current evidence. A progress or ranking argument is a
well-founded measure proving that each recursive call moves closer to success;
for example, `clear(X)` in Blocks can use the number of blocks above `X` as a
decreasing measure, while a graph-search puzzle may require reasoning over
blank reachability and permutation distance. Until such a witness is
generated and validated, those goals remain outside the selected benchmark
claim rather than being patched with domain-specific code.

## Numeric Support

Numeric fluent support is an explicit compiler extension, not a silent
translation of numeric PDDL into classical predicates. A numeric fluent is a
PDDL function whose value is part of the state, for example `(ferry-capacity)`
or `(capacity ?vehicle)`. A numeric condition is a comparison over such values,
for example `(> (capacity ?vehicle) 0)`. A numeric effect is an update such as
`(decrease (capacity ?vehicle) 1)` or `(increase (ferry-capacity) 1)`.

The implemented fragment is bounded integer-resource PDDL:

- numeric functions have finite integer values in the problem initial state;
- numeric preconditions use simple comparisons against constants or another
  parsed numeric term;
- numeric effects use `increase` and `decrease` by constant amounts;
- numeric problem goals may use equality between one declared numeric fluent and
  one integer target value;
- numeric fluents are used as action applicability and resource accounting, not
  as recursive ranking proofs for graph-search-style goals;
- generated action traces are still validated by a PDDL validator that supports
  numeric fluents.

Under this fragment, AgentSpeak(L) plans use numeric beliefs as executable
state, for example `capacity(v1,2)`, and primitive action execution updates
those beliefs according to the PDDL numeric effect. The final ASL library uses
declared PDDL function names directly. For example, the numeric goal
`(= (pogo_sticks_to_make) 0)` is represented as:

```asl
+!pogo_sticks_to_make(0) : pogo_sticks_to_make(N) & N == 0 <-
	true.

+!pogo_sticks_to_make(0) : pogo_sticks_to_make(N) & N > 0 & position(crafting_table) <-
	craft_wooden_pogo;
	!pogo_sticks_to_make(0).
```

The first plan is the already-true branch: if the numeric belief already equals
the target, no primitive action is needed. The second plan is the monotone
resource branch: it is emitted only when validated Evidence Module macro
evidence and the PDDL schema show that the primitive action decreases the
target resource by one. In the current experiments, that evidence comes from
the MOOSE readable-policy provider.

The implemented pipeline now:

1. distinguishes metric-only action costs from logical numeric resources in the
   PDDL support audit;
2. parses functions, numeric initial assignments, numeric preconditions,
   numeric effects, and numeric equality goals into typed internal structures;
3. seeds numeric fluents as mutable Jason beliefs and applies numeric
   `increase`/`decrease` effects during primitive action execution;
4. renders numeric contexts such as `capacity(V,N) & N > 0`;
5. validates Evidence Module numeric macro evidence against predicate and
   numeric schema conditions before rendering ASL;
6. accepts numeric resource functions as singleton LTLf/DFA progress atoms by
   adding the target value as the final argument. For example, the PDDL function
   `(pogo_sticks_to_make)` is legal in a DFA transition as
   `pogo_sticks_to_make(0)`, which appends the subgoal
   `!pogo_sticks_to_make(0)`;
7. relies on VAL or an equivalent numeric-capable validator for final action
   trace justification.

The deployed query path remains the temporal path:
validated lifted LTLf JSON, then LTLf-to-DFA, then conjunctive/negative/numeric
guard validation, then AgentSpeak(L) append with a query-local primitive-step
DFA monitor. Direct PDDL test-goal wrappers are only an evaluation bridge for
benchmark smoke runs where the input is a PDDL problem file rather than a user
query specification. Those bridge plans are marked with
`evaluation_pddl_goal_wrapper_bridge` metadata and must not be described as the
final natural-language query interface.

Unsupported numeric cases include arbitrary arithmetic expressions, real-valued
updates, optimization metrics as achievement goals, non-equality numeric goals,
and numeric goals that require a recursive ranking proof not present in the
validated evidence.

## Five-Seed Full Compiler Results

The final submitted compiler is the Full GP2PL variant with validated policy
lifting and Clingo selection. Each of the five evidence seeds is trained,
compiled, and evaluated independently on the same declared 1,228-case set;
evidence is neither pooled nor selected by best seed.

The five independent 1,228-case runs for seeds 0--4 obtain 1,224, 1,219,
1,187, 1,205, and 1,224 Jason-plus-original-goal-VAL successes. The per-seed
mean is 98.68% and the sample standard deviation is 1.29 percentage points.
All 6,059 successful traces pass VAL; none of the 6,140 repeated evaluations
times out or exits nonzero. Among the 1,228 distinct cases, 1,180 succeed for
all seeds, 46 are seed-sensitive, and only Depots `p12` and `p20` fail for all
five. Fourteen domains are complete under every seed, accounting for
5,635/5,635 successful seed--case executions. Variation is confined to
Logistics and Depots. Diagnostic inspection finds missing long cross-mode
provider macros beside a cyclic `at`/`in` constructor boundary in Logistics,
and nested typed support-resource choices beyond the current already-bound
capacity-discharge witness in Depots. These diagnoses explain the observed
implementation boundary but are not impossibility proofs for the domains.

The compact record is
`paper_artifacts/gp2pl_evaluation/v1/five_seed_full_compiler_summary.json`.
It stores the experiment protocol, all 6,140 seed--case outcomes, exact outcome
patterns, per-domain counts, and failure diagnostics. The public schema omits
run identifiers, source revisions, byte digests, and machine-local paths; every
reported aggregate is recomputable from the included outcomes. Cross-seed
timing is excluded because unrelated workloads overlapped the runs.

## Five-Seed Temporal Execution Results

The selected Certified Balanced controller executes the complete 1,228-case
benchmark with each independently compiled seed-specific atomic-library set,
using six workers, 1,800-second Jason and VAL limits, and a 64-MiB Java stack.
Evidence is neither pooled nor selected by best seed.

All 6,140 seed--case executions have an explicit Jason success marker, a
complete primitive PDDL action trace accepted by neutral-goal VAL, and
acceptance by both the gold and predicted finite-trace automata. Every one of
the 1,228 queries succeeds under all five seeds, with no seed-sensitive case;
primitive-action counts are also invariant across seeds. Each predicted formula
is compiled and executed once per core, while gold-DFA and predicted-DFA
acceptance are two checks on the same replayed state trace rather than separate
controller executions. Mean per-seed PAR-2 is 5.36 seconds with a 0.27-second
sample standard deviation.

This result establishes complete execution coverage only for the released
benchmark, five supplied atomic-library sets, and declared temporal and numeric
fragments. It does not establish action-strategy completeness for arbitrary
PDDL-times-LTLf products, arbitrary arithmetic planning, or universal
realizability under every type-compatible parameter assignment.

The conference-neutral evaluation-table generator is
`scripts/generate_evaluation_tables.py`. It requires exact, duplicate-free
coverage of all benchmark sample identifiers and checks every reported semantic
outcome before producing `result_macros.tex`, the per-domain table, the
per-profile table, and `evaluation_results.json`. For the supplied libraries it
records 1,568 joint certified candidates, 1,527 selected branches, and 638.4 KiB
of ASL. Synthesis and compiler runtimes are not inferred from diagnostic logs.

## Temporal Semantic Conformance Suite

The versioned suite at
`paper_artifacts/temporal_semantic_conformance/v1/suite.json` checks the
declared finite-trace semantics independently of the 1,228-case execution
benchmark. Its hand-specified positive and negative traces cover atoms,
literal negation, same-state conjunction, Eventually, strong Next, strong
Until, and numeric-equality observation. Every case must agree among the
expected result, a direct recursive finite-trace evaluator, and the DFA
constructed by the real `ltlf2dfa`/MONA path. This avoids using the same DFA
implementation as both the system under test and its only semantic oracle.

LTLf traces are non-empty state sequences. A zero-action execution is therefore
the singleton trace containing the PDDL initial state, not an empty logical
trace. The suite contains predicate and integer-equality cases that are already
true initially. Both must produce an explicit Jason success marker, an empty
committed PDDL action file, a replay with zero actions and one state, and gold
and predicted DFA acceptance.

VAL 1.4 rejects an empty plan file as a malformed plan and exposes no
zero-action syntax. The validator therefore does not insert a synthetic noop
or label such a case as VAL-accepted. For zero actions, PDDL replay establishes
the initial state and action legality is vacuous; the result records
`legality_certificate=vacuous_zero_action_pddl_replay`,
`val_attempted=false`, and `val_success=null`. Every non-empty execution still
requires independent neutral-goal VAL acceptance. The sealed execution
benchmark contains only state-changing witnesses, so its 1,228 VAL results are
unchanged.

Pinned run `temporal-conformance-paper-67b82843` was produced from clean commit
`67b82843`. All 14 formula-semantics cases agree with their hand-specified
expectations under both independent evaluators, and both zero-action integration
cases pass Jason, singleton-state replay, and both DFA checks. Exact inputs,
tool versions, hashes, and per-case records are stored in
`paper_artifacts/temporal_semantic_conformance/v1/release_validation.json`.
